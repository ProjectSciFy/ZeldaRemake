File being reviewed: Boomerang.cs
Author of code: Gage Odom

Time taken on code review: 15 minutes

REVIEW:

-Important variables were often described through comments which helps the reader understand the purpose and existence of said variables. Important variables are
also given concise and detailed names to make reading the code feel more logical. In addition to this, comments were usually found above method implementations 
with a few exceptions. It would help the readability of the code if the author described the reasoning behind the "Inward()" and "Outward()" functions.

-The boomerang movement code is well commented to describe what is being accomplished. The trajectory logic could use a little bit more commenting or just a small
amount of text paraphrasing the calculations used. Code is overall very easy to read and should be very easy to maintain since Boomerang is its own class. Fascinating
that the boomerang code can be applied in multiple areas of the game.
