Sprint 2 Reflection

To reflect over how our group performed throughout the duration of this sprint, we want 
to discuss things we felt we excelled with and also areas of improvement. To start with
our strengths, the structure and design of the code follows a synchronous pattern that is
pleasing to the eye and easy to maintain. However, our team ran into several time related
issues that constrained the depth of the code. With that said, our team felt as if we could
have put the petal down earlier but are proud with the product. Sprint 2 was an amazing team
bonding experience.
