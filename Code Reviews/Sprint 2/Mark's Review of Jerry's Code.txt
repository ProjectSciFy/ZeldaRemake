Readability:
Duration: 5 minutes
Comments: very readable, the switch case in Execute() makes sense as to what its doing & is in little to no way confusing.
The only think I might personally consider is adding a comment to both constructors to expand upon the purpose for overloading the class.

Code Quality:
Comments: The quality is pretty solid, owed mostly to the simplicity of the class as a whole.
As is, the code is very maintainable as well; if new state booleans were to be added into the incoming stateMachine, one could simply increase the size of the switch case to accomodate.
