-Comments: Overall, very easy to read since variable, field, enum, and method names are very clear. Switch-case logic was a bit long to follow, but similar format between 
           cases made readability level high.


MAINTAINABILITY OF ANDREW'S TileStateMachine.cs:

-Comments: Currently, relatively high maintainability -- although the file is fairly short, the switch-case logic means that each update call hard-codes the texture changes, 
           which means that any new textures to be added will require basically copy-pasting these new textures multiple times both in TileStateMachine and in TileSpriteFactory.
           The same will be true for removing textures.
-Hypitheitcal changes: Possibly the creation of a list-like object for holding textures would make maintainability easier.
