-Comments: The maintainability of BlockTile.cs and StairsTile.cs is very high; not much code needs to be refactored to change any future texture or position. However, 
		   TileSpriteFactory might be a little difficult to maintain in the future due to the creation of a new Universal Sprite in each method call.
-Hypitheitcal changes: Perhaps to add the possibility of a state machine in case of moving/sliding tiles.
