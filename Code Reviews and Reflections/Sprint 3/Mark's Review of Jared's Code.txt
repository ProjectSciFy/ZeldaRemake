-Sprint Number: 3
-File Name: AquamentusSpriteFactory.cs, EnemyAquamentus.cs, and AquamentusStateMachine.cs
-Author of file: Jared Zahn
-Number of minutes taken to review: 4
-Comments: EnemyAquamentus.cs does not have good readability due to the length of the file and how difficult its Update() method is to understand.
		   The same is true with AquamentusStateMachine.cs. AquamentusSpriteFactory.cs has pretty high readability- file and methods are short and names make sense.


MAINTAINABILITY OF JARED'S AquamentusSpriteFactory.cs, EnemyAquamentus.cs, and AquamentusStateMachine.cs (all 3 were refactored):

-Number of minutes taken to review: 6
-Comments: EnemyAquamentus.cs and AquamentusStateMachine.cs both do not have good maintainability due to the length of the files and how complex their Update() method are, 
		   which would make refactoring difficult. AquamentusSpriteFactory.cs has pretty high maintainability- file overall is simple and the fields are made private.
-Hypitheitcal changes: Shorten the Update() methods in EnemyAquamentus.cs and AquamentusStateMachine.cs, and possibly change fields to private.
