Sprint 3 Reflection

Overall, our group is proud of what we managed to accomplish given an incredibly busy three weeks for all of us. Although we did not manage to
complete all of the mentioned requirements of the sprint in time, we believe that we will be able to introduce all of the collisions and graphical
special cases into the next sprint. We realized we did not set up our Github.com repository and burndown chart tasks correctly, which threw us
off course and forced us to work last minute again. We have now learned how to set up our project taskboard, and we will be able to work much sooner 
in the three weeks on sprint 4.
