-Comments: This file has fairly high readability. Despite being long and containing multiple methods and fields, all the names of variables,
		   methods, and fields were apt and concise and allowed for easy understanding of logic. The code in each method was short and conditional
		   logic was made easy to understand by the good naming conventions.

-Comments: The maintainability of this file is fairly low. The file is long and unwieldy, having a multitude of methods and public fields which 
		   make for high coupling and low cohesion. Despite apt names, the Update() method is very dense and would be difficult to maintain.
-Hypitheitcal changes: Decouple class by removing fields and methods from the file into helper methods and files. Also, reducing the number of 
					   public fields possibly.
