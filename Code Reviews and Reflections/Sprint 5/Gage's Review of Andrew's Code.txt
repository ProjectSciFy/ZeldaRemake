-Comments: Alot of code in the constuctor. Looks like its required though so thats okay. Background is only depends on its storage class along with game so thats good. Storage class gives easy point of access to changes.
-Hypitheitcal changes: Maybe reduce amount of conditionals in constructor. Also putting the entirety of the variable values into the storage class instead of just bits and pieces may help readablity too.
