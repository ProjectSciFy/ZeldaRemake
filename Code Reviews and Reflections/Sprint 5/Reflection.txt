Sprint 5 Reflection

We made a considerable effort to catch up on sprint 4 features. Once we finished implementing previously desired features,
we developed new additions to the game. After these additions, we cleaned up the code heavily and refactored long files to 
increase readability and cohesion. Overall, we managed to make impressive changes to the game despite being a bit behind 
from sprint 4. We got to know each other super well and we are very happy with our final result.
