The overall is quite easy to read. There's not any complex loops or logic. It's clear what this file does. I can go line by line fairly easily
and understand what each line is doing. Each section is split nicely to understand in order what is reset for the method. Nothing too complex and each
method is easy to understand how they connect.

My initial thoughts are that this code is very maintainable. It seems obvious that the more you add, the more you reset. This code does a good job
of centralizing everything that needs to be reset at the core. In addition, it is clear that you can continue to reset what you add. Gal does a nice job
of making sure you can reset everything from this file. 
-Hypitheitcal changes: 
I would add a method for all values that need to be reset, and a list of all initial values. That way, if you add something that, for example, has a counter, you
can easily add it and then reset it from the method that resets everything. This could separate the code from, for example, recreating rooms.
