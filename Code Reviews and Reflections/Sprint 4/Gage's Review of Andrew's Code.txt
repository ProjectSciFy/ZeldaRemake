-Comments: The readability is pretty good. The variables names in use give an understanding on what information they hold. The 
only thing not obvious is the getDoorValue() conditional in the if statement onl line 41. After asking you then I understand what it
means but on first glance its almost impossible to know wht that calculation gives.

-Comments: The maintainablity of this class is good assuming rooms of similar structures are added. If a room where there were more 
than 4 doors in different cardinal directions then problems may arise.
-Hypitheitcal changes: Come up with a more obvious system than using mod 10 as a way to identify doors. Maybe with enums so a reader 
will understand better. Other than that code looks great.
