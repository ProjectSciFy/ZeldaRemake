-Number of minutes taken to review: 5
-Comments: The file as a whole is easily understood and variable names are kept concise and beneficial to each respective purpose. Each state for the game itself follows the same form
as it implements the IGameState interface. This allows the audience to not only understand PauseState, but also apply the structural understanding of the code to any of the game states.
This file has high readabililty and without the presence of comments, still conveys its purpose logically. 


MAINTAINABILITY OF DEVAN'S :

-Comments: The maintainablity of this code file also lies within the IGameState interface that it implements. There are very few magic numbers, most being taken care of by initialized
variables. In addition to this, the file is under 50 lines total which helps the viewer see every aspect of the class without having to parse through too many lines of code. 
-Hypotheitcal changes: The complexity of the class is meant to be very simple, so my changes would be focused on beefing up the graphical output of the "pause" screen and
adding other functionalities found in most pause screens: quit game option, save game option, etc.
