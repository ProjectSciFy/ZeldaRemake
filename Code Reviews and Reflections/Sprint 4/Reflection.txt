Sprint 4 Reflection

Our group began planning for and working on this sprint far earlier than for previous sprints. This resulted in a more organized
approach and time management to solve issues with code readability and maintainability from earlier sprints. We were able to work 
together early to resolve many code quality concerns and refactor legacy code. This resulted in a much more successful attempt at
meeting the requirements for sprint 4, both in terms of code quality and in terms of code functionality. We are very proud of the
effort and corresponding success we have had during this sprint with the refactoring of code, the production of functional visual
results, and with our implementation of aspects of the game.
