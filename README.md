# ZeldaRemake

README Document for Sprint 3:

Program Known Bugs:
	-Some enemies have unique actions such as fireball attacks and randomized movement. This will be updated in the future to adapt to the realities of our game as it evolves.

Program Controls:
	-[WASD] and [Arrows] keys control vertical and horizontal movement.
		+No diagonal movement. Key priority-based movement (i.e.: last key pressed is the direction link moves; if key is held and another is pressed, he moves in the new direction).	
	-[N] and [Z] cause Link to attack with his sword.
	-[1]...[4] are meant to cycle between link's items and their respective animations.
		+Currently, only the sword can be used. Bomb, boomerang, and bow/arrow will be added in the future.
	-[R] resets all sprites to original locations and states.
	-[Q] and [esc] quit the game instantly.

Program Future Implementations:

Program Extra Implementations:
	-[1]...[4] change Link's item AND perform the intended items' animations. Currently the items are not spawning, but their animations are coded.
